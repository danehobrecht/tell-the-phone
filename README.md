NOTES & CONCEPTS

Start out with the following rudimentary capabilites before considering more advanced ones:
- Standard, cellular phone calls
- Phonebook (contact storage)
In short, base all of the initial features solely off of the provisions of a cell tower, minus the data.

Try to use reminiscent language anywhere applicable in the operating system; i.e., "Phonebook" instead of "Contacts"
