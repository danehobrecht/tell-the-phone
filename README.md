# tell-the-phone

To start the configuration:\
`cd sh && chmod 755 run-all.sh && ./run-all.sh`

## What?
"tell-the-phone" is a compilation of scripts, tools, and applications to transform the Sonim XP3plus into a genuine dumb-phone.

## Why?
I have spent too many hours of my life trying to configure smartphones into something they are not. While there are many reasons for doing this, in short, I was simply not made to handle their capabilities. In an attempt to solve this, I decided to go with an extreme approach (which tends to be a very common approach for me): the Sonim XP3plus rugged flip-phone. It was everything I dreamed of in a phone: limited features, modern ports, removable battery, and on my network. Upon learning that this phone came with very watered down smart features, I grew even more frustrated to the point where I made this repository.

## Some other notes:
- I highly recommend covering the secondary screen on the outer lid with duct tape. If you have the camera version, this conveniently spans over the lens as well. Setting a password in system settings introduces a clock on the lock-screen that is otherwise lost when covering the secondary screen. The nail in the coffin here is the fact that you cannot adjust the brightness value, and its default setting is absolutely eye frying.
