# tell-the-phone

To start the configuration:\
`cd sh && chmod 755 run-all.sh && ./run-all.sh`

## Some notes:
I highly recommend covering the secondary screen featured on the outer lid of the phone with duct tape (which, if you have the camera version, may conveniently span over the lens for my privacy-minded friends). Provided you set a password in system settings (this introduces a clock on the lock-screen that is otherwise lost with the neglect of the secondary screen) it is largely unneccesary. The nail in the coffin here is the fact that you cannot adjust the brightness value, and its default setting is absolutely eye frying. "Night usage" is a "Night Mare".
