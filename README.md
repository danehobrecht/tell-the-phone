# tell-the-phone

To start the configuration:\
`cd sh && chmod 755 run-all.sh && ./run-all.sh`

## What?
"tell-the-phone" is a compilation of scripts, tools, and applications that should help one transform the Sonim XP3plus into a truly dumb-phone.

## Why?
I have spent too many hours of my life trying to configure smartphones into something they are not. While there are many reasons for me doing this, in short, I can simply no longer handle the extent to which modern phones are capable. To each their own. In order to solve this personal dilemma, I decieded to go with the extreme approach (which is, sometimes unfortunately, a very common approach for me) and purchase what I thought was going to be a good soluton: the Sonim XP3plus rugged flip-phone. It was everything I dreamed in a mobile phone: limited features, modern ports, removable battery, and, most notably, on my network. Upon learning that this phone came with nearly every feature a smartphone did (granted, very watered down versions of them) I grew even more frustrated to the point where I made yet another emotional outlet repository.

## Some other notes:
I highly recommend covering the secondary screen featured on the outer lid of the phone with duct tape (which, if you have the camera version, may conveniently span over the lens for my privacy-minded friends). Provided you set a password in system settings (this introduces a clock on the lock-screen that is otherwise lost with the neglect of the secondary screen) it is largely unneccesary. The nail in the coffin here is the fact that you cannot adjust the brightness value, and its default setting is absolutely eye frying. "Night usage" is a "Night Mare".
