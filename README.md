# tell-the-phone

To start the configuration:\
`cd sh && chmod 755 run-all.sh && ./run-all.sh`

## Why?
I have spent too much of my life trying to configure smartphones into something they are not. They are smart. That is final. I am not talking groceries, we're talking about uncomfortably capable phones. In order to solve this dilemma, I decieded to go with an extreme approach (which is, sometimes unfortunately, a very common approach for me) and purchase what was supposed to be a "dumb phone". Upon learning that this "dumb phone" came with nearly every feature a smartphone did (granted, very watered down version of them) I grew even more frustrated to the point where I made another repo about it. This repository is a compilation of scripts and tools that should help you, as it has helped me, transform this specific model of dum bphone into a truly dumb-phone.

## Some other notes:
I highly recommend covering the secondary screen featured on the outer lid of the phone with duct tape (which, if you have the camera version, may conveniently span over the lens for my privacy-minded friends). Provided you set a password in system settings (this introduces a clock on the lock-screen that is otherwise lost with the neglect of the secondary screen) it is largely unneccesary. The nail in the coffin here is the fact that you cannot adjust the brightness value, and its default setting is absolutely eye frying. "Night usage" is a "Night Mare".
